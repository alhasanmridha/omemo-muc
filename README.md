# clocc
Command Line OMEMO Chat Client

This is a really quick and dirty thrown together command line chat client mainly used to test [smack-omemo](https://github.com/vanitasvitae/smack-omemo). 
Use it on your own risk if you are into kinky things like dirty lines of code...

To build it, you must first clone smack-omemo and install it in your local maven repo:

```
git clone git@github.com:vanitasvitae/smack-omemo.git
cd smack-omemo
git checkout 4.2
gradle install
```

Next you can clone and build clocc:

```
cd ..
git clone git@github.com:vanitasvitae/clocc.git
cd clocc
gradle assemble
```

You can find the finished jar in `build/libs`.

Have fun!
